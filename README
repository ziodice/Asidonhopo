Asidonhopo IRC bot for #zibohack on freenode

To use, just run start.pl; it will create an example
configuration file which you can use.

Commands may be placed in Asidonhopo/Command.
Note that they can be added on the fly.

Triggers work like this:
in the trigger database, table "triggers":
when "trigger" matches something, say
"speech". "trigger" is a Perl regular expression.

Special sequences in trigger and speech:
trigger:
    §    - at the beginning of a trigger, this matches
           CTCP ACTIONs.
    §me§ - bot nick
speech:
    §then§ - new message.
    §act§  - as first thing in message only; CTCP ACTION
             the text.
    §nick§ - whoever triggered it.
